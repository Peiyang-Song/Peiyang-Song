- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Peiyang Song, an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at California Institute of Technology (Caltech). I am a researcher in the Computation & Cognition Lab (CoCoLab) at Stanford University.
- ðŸ‘€ My current research interest is in machine reasoning, especially AI for mathematics. During the past, I have also worked on energy-efficient machine learning systems.
- ðŸŒ± My recent research is mainly in two directions: 1) neuro-symbolic reasoning and AI4Math combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with Interactive Theorem Provers (ITPs); 2) energy-efficient machine learning with temporal logic and other novel designs.
- ðŸ“« I'm always open to collaborations. Please feel free to email me at psong@caltech.edu.
