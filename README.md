- 👋 Hi, I’m @Peiyang Song (he/him/his), currently a BS Candidate in Computer Science, College of Creative Studies (CCS) Honors, University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB).
- 👀 My research interests include Machine Learning (ML) and its applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), as well as its intersections with Computer Architecture, Programming Language (PL) and beyond.
- 🌱 My recent research works are mainly in two directions: 1) neural theorem proving and automated reasoning combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with Interactive Theorem Provers (ITPs); 2) temporal logic for energy-efficient machine learning inference.
- 💞️ I’d love to collaborate on projects in computer science, not necessarily restricted to the research interests stated above! 
- 📫 Please feel free to contact me by email p_song@ucsb.edu. I check it frequently :)
